	-- USPTO Algorithm Followup Challenge

4. Dataset Information:
    -- This folder contains 4 groups of USPTO patent images including ground truth information. 
	-- The 4 groups are 'train1', 'train2', 'test', 'evaluation'. 
	-- 'train1', 'test', 'evaluation' contains data in the original "USPTO Algorithm Challenge" for training, testing and final evaluation, respectively.
	-- 'train2' contains additional data which was used in the "USPTO Algorithm Followup Challenge."  
	   Notice that 'train2' includes some cover page images of patent document which is not included in other groups.

    -- In each group, there are two folders contain original images and corresponding ground truth informations. 
	-- The original images are in 'jpeg' format.
	-- There are two types of ground truth: figure label ground truth and part label ground truth.
	-- The ground truth files are text files with '.ans' extension. 

    -- The structure of the ground truth files are described as below:
	-- The first line is one number indicating how many instances exist in corresponding image
	-- The following lines are bounding box coordinates and corresponding label contents, each line corresponds to a figure label or part label, in the form 'N x1 y1 x2 y2 â€¦ xN yN x1 y1 content'. 
	-- In each of those lines, the first number N indicates how many bounding box vertices are recorded in current instance. 
	-- The following numbers are x, y coordinates of those vertices.
	-- The final word in each line is the content of figure label or part label. <Notice for figure labels, the word 'Figure', 'Fig' etc. are omitted>
	-- Each number or word is separated by a white space.
	-- For group 'train2', there are only part label ground truth available.
	-- We also release the source code of the top 5 winning solution. See additional archive file.
